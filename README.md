# Twilight Watcher
Sorting the colour spectra of dawn and dusk. This script is intented to run on a RaspberryPi continuously watching a webcam and scraping data twice a day, from which it will generate colourful pictures that show the sweeping often surprising shifts in colour. Each full revolution of colours marks either astronomical twilight to the end of golden hour or the start of golden hour to the end of astronomical twilight.

For the resulting pictures generated from watching and sorting the data from a publically accessible webcam situated at an observatory in the Almerian mountains, check out: https://ribenamaplesyrup.github.io/
